Dependencies:

pysam (sudo easy_install pysam)
numpy (sudo apt-get install python-numpy)

caveats:
  a chromosome must be referenced in the BED to be included (shortcut for excluding mitochondrial and small alternate chromosomes)
  read pairs with the same coordinates are ignored, as are secondary alignments
  
See BED file from http://eqtl.uchicago.edu/Masking/ (give citation too!)
